# Florence-Hurricane-Geospatial-Analysis

I have used 2 datasets, the FlorenceHurricanData.json contains the longitude and latitude of the hurricane with other related data fields. The USStatesGeoData file contains the states' polygon data. I have used Python and the Geopandas module for this project.

The following map shows Hurricane Florence on the USA map. We can conclude from it that the hurricane started to slow down as it approached the east coast and it was strongest when it was offshore.
